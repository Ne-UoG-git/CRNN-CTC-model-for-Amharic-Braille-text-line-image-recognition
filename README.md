This dataset was created and made available online for free to researchers working on Amharic Braille document recognition. 
The dataset contains 2100 Amharic Braille document Line-images, in which 2000 line-images are for training and 100 line images for testing with the corresponding Ground-Truth (GT) labels.
Line-images are stored in grayscale with .Png file format and named with numbers starting from 0001 with their equivalent line number in the label text , and 248 characters have been included in the labels.
For example: text in the first line of label.txt is transcription for image 0001.png(first image) in line images folder, and so on.you can use the following link to download the dataset.
